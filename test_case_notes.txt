Test Case Notes

TO-DO:
1.update tokenize.ml, which will affect   DONE
	_arithemic.out output and more

        > update scanner_test.sh before using it 	
	> after fixing all the syntax, try to run the scanner test by running scanner_test.sh
	> add fail cases

2.add success & fail tests for parser
        > update parserize.ml for our syntax
        > record what data structures is not covered yet
        > fix Makefile before running tests in this folder
        > more tests
 
3. add success & fail tests for typer
        > update Makefile & typer_check.ml if needed before running tests in the folder
        > more tests
        
4. add success & fail tests for codegen
        > after May 1st

------------------------------------------------------------------
create a Makefile in each of the folders (scanner, parser, typer, codegen),
and then create a Makefile in the tests folder, which can run all the tests in the sub-folders above.


NOT COVERED YET:
1. Scanner

2. Parser
        > record (dict)
        > graph
